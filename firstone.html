    <p> So we're stuck at home and I decided to take up computer programming again. This <br> time I don't want it to stay as just a fling hobby I'm serious now. The past couple of <br> days have proved pretty stressful, and I began to think of the future and what I'll <br> with my life. </p>
    <p> Computer programming is a very good choice for me because of:
    <br> A.Intrigue: Solving problems can be interesting, stimulating and satisfying.
    <br> B. Money: Life's a sandwhich, no matter which way you flip it the <br>
    bread comes first. Computer programmers get bank.
    <br> C. Flexability: If you know me, then you know why this is so important. <br>
    Somedays I won't be feeling it, somedays I can't make it, <br> somedays I won't do much, some days I'll go overdrive. I need <br> to be able to pray when I need it, go places in emergencies, and be at home<br>when I'm needed.

    </p>

    <p> The work atmosphere at tech companies is also so much better than other fields  <br> and professions. Technology is the future guess I'll have to ride the wave to keep me saved.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm taking The Complete 2020 Web Developement Course at Udemy, and it's proving pretty useful. <br> Here I'll keep track of what I learn and my progress through time. <br><br>
