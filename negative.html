    <h4>negative</h4> <hr>
  <p>“Computer, open the main hatch!” cried Commander Olsen. “Negative” replied the on-board computer <br> in its’ cold, monotonous voice.”Dammit Perry find out what’s wrong with this bucket of bolts ASAP!” barked Olsen at his <br> lead technician, “Meanwhile I’ll get the job done manually.”

The two mechanics sent outside to repair <br> the solar panels could not find a way back in. They had been there to find out the fault behind the mysterious <br> power outage and stayed there since, their oxygen levels now reaching low levels and their lives currently at stake.

Perry <br> routinely ran diagnostics and tests to locate and eliminate quirks in the system back when the two-year voyage began, but <br> lately his results proved inconclusive. Commander Olsen donned his spacesuit while assembling a team from the vessel’s <br> crew, preparing to rescue the stranded pair. He placed his hands on the emergency hatch-

“I am afraid you cannot perform that action” <br> The whole crew were stunned because the computer never spoke unless it was spoken to, a basic rule for spaceship <br> supercomputers like itself. Everything clicked for Perry. The malfunctions, the power outage, the missing oxygen, <br>  all of it was linked.

The computer didn’t fail to comprehend or execute commands, it refused to.  <br> “Computer, do you mind telling me what this is all about?” asked Olsen. <br>

“Negative”</p>
