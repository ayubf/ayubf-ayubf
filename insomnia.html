  <h4>insomnia</h4> <hr>
  <p>I can't sleep at night.<br> My body restless, sleepless, <br> Your words sound heedless. <br> Can't tell if you mean it <br> The thought bouncing in my head near where it's the deepest.</p>
  <p>Tossing and turning, <br> Mind churning <br> The question is burning <br> </p>
  <p>I can't sleep at night <br> Blinded by your insensitive comment <br> I can't see the light <br> Felt uncomfortable to be honest <br> Didn't want to start a fight <br> Thought about it for the longest <br> I won't sleep tonight. </p>
