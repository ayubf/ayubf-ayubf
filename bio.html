      <p>about me <br> <br> I'm a 15 year old from Houston, TX, learning the ropes and <br>aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer. I am in my sophomore year <br> of high school and currently taking a course <br> on web developement. When I was 12 years old I was first <br> introduced to
        coding and fell in love <br> with it instantly. In more recent years things <br> have gotten in the way but now I'm back <br> and ready to commit myself. When I was <br> younger I learned basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS. <br>
        Now I think I'm ready to learn more. </p> <br>
